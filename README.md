# Welcome to My Mastermind
***

## Task
The problem is creating a program that works in a similar way as the classic Mastermind game. In the game you have 9 different colors and a code that is 4 digits long.
You must correctly decipher the code using the 9 different colors in the correct order. These colors are shown as as the integer 0-9. 

## Description
Creating three functions for the program. 
1. generatecode, which uses a for loop to generate a random code.
2. isValidInput, which checks to see if the input has digits between 0-8.
3. count_well_placed and count_misplaced check to see if any of the numbers in the guess are well placed, meaning that they are in the correct spot in the code, 
    or misplaced, meaing that they are present in the code but are in the wrong position.
4. main, which brings it all together. Using loops and print statements, the game prompts the starting message. 
   Then depending on if you input a valid guess you get printed statements informing you of if you have a made a valid guess or how close you are to getting the code correct.
   If you input something invalid, it also informs you of that.
