# Welcome to My Mastermind
***

## Task
The problem is creating a program that works in a similar way as the classic Mastermind game. In the game you have 9 different colors and a code that is 4 digits long.
You must correctly decipher the code using the 9 different colors in the correct order. These colors are shown as as the integer 0-9. 

## Description
Creating three functions for the program. 
1. generatecode, which uses a for loop to generate a random code.
2. isValidInput, which checks to see if the input has digits between 0-8.
3. main, which brings it all together. Using loops adn print statements, the game prompts the starting message. 
   Then depending on if you input a valid code guess you get printed statements informing yu of if you have a made a valid guess or how close you are to getting the code correct.
